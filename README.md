# Making Edits

Set up a simple http server to view edits you make locally. [This guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) should help with that. Refresh the localhost tab to view changes after saving them in your code editor.

# Pull Requests

Please never commit to master, even if you have permission.
Run all changes by the Head of Infrastructure. Here are the steps to making a change and solving an issue:

1) Make a branch off ```master```. Please give it a descriptive message.

2) Commit your changes onto your branch.

3) Push your branch changes.

4) Once you're ready, create a pull request with base as the ```master```.

5) Write a descriptive title and comment. You can reference the associated issue with a #.

# Style Guide
* You can do tabs or spaces, but please set your tab to 4 spaces.

* Use camelCase, not snake_case.

* Put braces on the right.

* Lines should not be longer than 80 characters.

* Put a comment above each function describing what it does.

* Alphabetize your CSS.
