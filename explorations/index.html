            <p>A warm welcome to the WCS Explorations, WCS’s sub-committee to help you with all things
                technical! We offer frequent workshops to hone your technical skills for classes and
                personal projects, interview preparation workshops to help you ace your next job
                interview, and project teams for a chance to work together in groups of about six
                people (including a project manager) and learn on-the-job skills. We also host the
                annual female and non-binary only hackathon, Code Ada, in October! If you have any
                questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to
                <a href="mailto:darciap2@illinois.edu">Darci Peoples</a> or
                <a href="mailto:myc2@illinois.edu">Melissa Chen</a>.

            <h1 align="center">[NEW!] Question Box</h1>
            <p>
                WCS is launching our own ask box where you can ask questions about any CS/non-CS related
                topics! In the upcoming weeks, we will invite special speakers to answer questions about
                cool topics like machine learning, research, etc. Just submit a question in this form and
                we’ll get back to you in a few days! We want this to be safe space, so if you choose to,
                you can remain anonymous. Go to <a href="https://go.illinoiswcs.org/question-box">our website</a> to see past
                questions and answers or ask your own!
            </p>

            <h1 align="center">WCS Explorations Book Club</h1>
            <p>Alongside learning the technical skills that will help our members succeed, book club
                will be encouraging the developers of the future to consider the history and ethics
                of computer science. We're kicking off our pilot book club with
                <i>Algorithms of Oppression</i> by Safiya Noble. If you are interested in joining
                our weekly discussions, which will be taking place synchronously on Zoom every Monday
                at 5 PM CST and asynchronously on Slack, join the
                <a href="https://tinyurl.com/wcsslackinvite" target="_blank">WCS Slack</a> and hop in the #book-club
                channel. We will be posting the weekly reading schedule, holding asynchronous
                discussions, and making announcements there.

            <h1 align="center">Project Teams</h1>
            <p>This year, WCS is hosting eight project teams working on a variety of projects with
                social good and engineering education applications. From adding new features to existing
                campus accessibility tools or creating a STEM trivia application, to crafting a racial
                microaggression detector or imagining new tools to help students stay productive during
                the pandemic, our project teams are set on taking on some of the greatest challenges
                posed to our community in 2021. <b>Corporate sponsors: </b> if you are interested in
                learning more about our student's work or participating in our midpoint or final
                presentations, please reach out to
