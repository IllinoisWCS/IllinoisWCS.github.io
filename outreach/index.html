              Welcome to WCS Outreach! We are the subdivision of WCS dedicated to
              encouraging young women to pursue a computer science education.
              Although 51% of the United States population is female, only 18% of
              Computer Science bachelor’s degrees are earned by women.
              Women’s voices are needed in tech, and we want to do our part in making
              those numbers change.
              <br>
              <br>
              We have multiple initiatives: Chictech, High School Visits, our Explore CS Series, and CS+X Panel.

              In the Fall 2020 semester, WCS Outreach presented an informative video
              series about the research the professors at UIUC professors have done using
              computer science applications, to impact different fields of work. We hope
              this will allow young teenagers, and possibly even <b>you</b> reading this,
              to learn more about the opportunities available through studying computer
              science!
              <br />
              <br />
              We brought professors from all fields of expertise to talk about how they
              have used computer science to complete their research and how it affects
              the field they work in, as well as communities around the world!
              <br />

              The University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign is known for having a
              variety of diverse CS related majors available for students to study.
              These majors fall under what is known as the CS+X Degree Program, which
              includes 11 majors in total (listed
              <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/cs-x-degree-programs"
                target="_blank">here</a>).
              In addition to these fields of study are the Mathematics & CS and Statistics & CS majors as well!
              <br />
              <br />
              This semester, WCS reached out to highschools across the country to involve
              students in our new CS+X Panel, which took place on Thursday, March 25th
              2021! We discussed the CS+X Program at the University of Illinois at Urbana
              Champaign, and had real Illinois CS+X university students come to talk about
              their experience and answer questions! Advisors from the CS department at
              UIUC also participated in the panel to talk about resources within the
              department.

              ChicTech is a full day event dedicated to introduce high schoolers to Computer Science by teaching them to
              make their own project to show off to friends and family. This year, we will be going through how to make
              your own website and data visualization using Github Pages, HTML/CSS, and d3.js! We will be having
              Professor Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider, the creator of many visualizations used by news organizations and the
              government, and Ritika Adhikari (CS Illinois 2020) as a keynote speaker and teaching the data
              visualization portion.
