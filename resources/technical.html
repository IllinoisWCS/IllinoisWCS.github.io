                <h2>Web Development</h2>
                <p>
                    For learning the basics of CSS, HTML, and Javascript, we recommend 
                    checking out online resources like 
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a>
                     or 
                    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a>. 
                    Other useful things to learn include frameworks for handling JSON data like 
                    <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery</a>, 
                    <a href="https://mustache.github.io/" target="_blank">Moustache</a>, and 
                    <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’re looking to skip styling your website or are looking for re-useable interfaces, 
                    check out <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> or 
                    <a href="https://getmdl.io/" target="_blank">Material Design Lite</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’re looking for something more advanced, check out awesome tools and 
                    frameworks like <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> 
                    for frontend, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, 
                    <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/" target="_blank">Flask</a>, 
                    or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> 
                    for backend. Other awesome frameworks exist! Don’t be afraid to Google for 
                    the tools that will meet your needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Often, when dealing with backend, you’ll also need a database. 
                    SQL and MongoDB are popular languages to learn, and you can find tutorials for these 
                    at the links in the first paragraph of this section. Another popular database is 
                    <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Google’s Firebase</a>, 
                    which has a free tier if you want to experiment with data.
                </p>
                <p>Lastly, if you’re looking to deploy your website, try out 
                    <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> 
                    (for static sites only), 
                    <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>, 
                    or <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netifly</a>. 
                    GitHub pages also is connected with Jekyll, making it easy for you to deploy your 
                    personal site or a project site using only markdown!
                </p>

                <br />
                <h2>Mobile Development</h2>
                <p>
                    There are a few different ways to develop mobile apps! If you're interested in developing for both 
                    Android and iOS, check out <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank">Flutter</a>, 
                    <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_blank">React Native</a>, or <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" 
                    target="_blank">Kotlin</a>. For all of these frameworks/languages, you 
                    can build native applications for both platforms without having to write in two different languages. 
                    Pretty convenient!
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if you're looking to build something for just one platform, you'll have to look at some 
                    more specific tools. For iOS, you will need to develop in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/" 
                    target="_blank">Swift</a>. The unfortunate barrier to this is that you must have an Apple device that runs 
                    XCode. If you're looking to work on Android applications, you can code in <a href="https://www.java.com/en/" 
                    target="_blank">Java</a> using <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank">Android Studio</a>, 
                    although it seems like the trend in Android to heading towards Kotlin and eventually Flutter. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For deploying your app, keep in mind that the iOS system has a more rigorous review process and requires that 
                    you join their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/" target="_blank">Apple Developer Program</a>, which 
                    costs roughly $100. The Android stores tend to be more lenient and usually don't require the paid subscription.
                </p>

                <br />
                <h2>Hardware</h2>
                <p>
                    Software is fun, but hardware is cool, too! If you're interested in trying out 
                    hardware, make sure to check out the <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/about/supplycenter"
                    target="_blank">ECE Supply Center</a>, which is open to all faculty, staff, and students 
                    and has a variety of hardware that you might be interested in. Also, the <a 
                    href="https://openlab.ece.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">ECE Open Lab</a> hosts tools and 
                    workspaces that you might find helpful as you explore more hardware! You will need to register 
                    and go through training in order to enter the lab. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some cool tech that lie at the intersection of hardware and software include <a href="https://openlab.ece.illinois.edu/"
                    target="_blank">Raspberry Pis</a> and <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">
                    Arduinos</a>, which are affordable, powerful single-board devices that can be connected to a 
                    variety of hardware. Check out their websites for tutorials and project ideas!
                </p>

                <br />
                <h2>Data Science and Visualization</h2>
                <p>
                    Data science and visualization is the art of taking data and turning it into a form that is 
                    easy to understand. Some commonly used languages for data science include 
                    <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> and 
                    <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, although other languages are used. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For data visualization, there are many packages in Python that can help with that, including 
                    <a href="https://plotly.com/" target="_blank">Plotly</a> and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/"
                    target="_blank">Matplotlib</a>. If you are more comfortable in Javascript, <a href="https://d3js.org/"
                    target="_blank">D3.js</a> is a powerful tool for making visualizations.
                </p>

                <br />
                <h2>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence is a fast growing and popular field in computer science. There are a lot of 
                    great tutorials and resources online, including <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/" target="_blank">
                    Towards Data Science</a>, among others. If you're specifically interested in machine learning, there are a 
                    lot of frameworks available. They are mostly based in Python, although there are others that exist in other 
                    languages. Some popular ones include <a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank">PyTorch</a> and 
                    <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">Tensorflow</a> for neural networks and 
                    <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html" target="_blank">Scikit Learn</a> for many other algorithms. 
                    All of these websites also have excellent tutorials that walk you through the applied basics. For more 
                    structured courses outside of UIUC, check out <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a>, 
                    <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank">MIT OpenCourseWare</a>, or <a href="https://www.edx.org/"
                    target="_blank">edX</a>.
